[general]
producer = Visaton
model = W100S8OHM
description = 10 cm (4") HiFi low-midrange driver with coated paper cone, elastic rubbersurround and 20 mm voice-coil. Suitable as woofer in mini-speaker systems and due to the very balanced frequency response especially suitable as low-midrange driver in 3-way speakers and in subwoofer/satellite systems.
