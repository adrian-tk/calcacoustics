Especially PC on Linux or Windows, IOS, Android. Rpi or other ARM shall also work. At this time no binaries are available, so only the Python scripts are avaiable. Python scripts Download files using git: git clone git@github.com:adrian-tk/calcacoustics.git In calcacoustic directory create a virtual environment and activate it: python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate Install all requirements with pip: pip install -r requirements.txt Run script: ./calcacoustics.py or click it in windows manager Android Build from script At this time there is no ready binaries, You can build them using buildozer 1. Get all Python script as in Python scirpts section 2. export path export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/ 3. build: buildozer -v android Binaries shall be in ./bin directory How To Calculate EBP?
