[general]
description = Section for speaker calculation

[r_pow]
name = rated power
value = 30.0
unit = W
desc = A speaker's power rating details the amount of power that it can safely handle.
calculate = False

[max_pow]
name = maximum power
value = 50.0
unit = W
desc = "Maximum power is the power that the speaker can handle for short periods of time without being damaged.

[z]
name = nominal impedance
value = 8.0
unit = Ohm
desc = nominal impedance is an estimate of the minimum impedance for typical  audio ranges usually 4, 8, or 16 Ohms

[Vas]
name = equivalent volume
value = 5.41
unit = l
desc="The Vas measurement in litres is the size of the ‘imaginary’ box which has exactly the same restoring force as the suspension of the driver.

[u_fr]
name = Upper frequency response
value = 15000.0
unit = Hz
esc = Upper frequecy of the driver in which' it shall work

[SPL]
name = Sound Pressure Level
value = 86.0
unit = dB
desc = Mean sound pressure level measured at power 1 W and 1m from speaker.

[fs]
name = Resonance frequency
value = 86.0
unit = Hz
desc = Mechanical resonance frequency of freely mounted speaker.

[Qts]
name = Total Q factor
value = 0.54
unit = Unitless
desc = inverse of damping ratio of speaker lower Q means more control: Qts<0.4 is usually for drivers for ported enclosure, 0.4<Qts>0.7 for closed, and Qts>0.7 for free-air or infite baffle type.

[Qes]
name = Electrical Q factor
value = 0.67
unit = Unitless
desc = is the amount of control coming from the electrical components of a speaker (the voice coil and magnet) which contribute to the suspension system.

[Qms]
name = Mechanical Q factor
value = 2.74
unit = Unitless

[Sd]
name = Effective piston area
value = 53.0
unit = cm2

[Mms]
name = Dynamically moved mass
value = 4.7
unit = g

[exc]
name = Excursion limit
value = 4
unit = mm

[Bxl]
name = Force factor
value = 4.29
unit = Txm

[L]
name = inductance of the voice coil
value = 0.9
unit = mH

[magI]
name = Magnetic induction
value = 1
unit = Tesla

[magfx]
name = Magnetic flux
value = 250.0
unit = uWeber

[weight]
name = net weigth
value = 0.49
unit = kg

[Rdc]
name = D.C. resistance
value = 6.7
unit = Ohm

[EBP]
name = Efficiency Bandwidth Product
value = 0.0
unit = Unitless
desc = shows the trade-off between efficiency and bandwidth of a driver. EBP < 50 - use only for a sealed box, EBP 50 - 100 - can be used in either, EBP > 100 - vented box only.
calculate = True
